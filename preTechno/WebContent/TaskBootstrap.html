	<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
		text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
		BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
		professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
		more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
		going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
		discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
		1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
		of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
		on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
		first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from
		a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
		since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
		1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
		also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
		versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
